# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [1.1.1] - 2022-07-05

Fixed pytest plugin name https://github.com/ipwnponies/pytest-antilru/pull/23
This was registering as *name_of_plugin* in pytest (from plugin example): besides being incorrect, it readily conflicts
with plugins who made the same mistake.

Thanks for @Kache for noticing and contributing a fix!

## [1.1.0] - 2022-01-29

Added support for python 3.8+.
Python 3.8 functools.lru_cache added support for using as a plain decorator.

```py
@lru_cache()
def oldway():
  ...

@lru_cache
def newway():
  ...
```
